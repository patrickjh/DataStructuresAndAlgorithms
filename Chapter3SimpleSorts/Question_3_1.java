 *3.1 In the bubbleSort.java program (Listing 3.1) and the BubbleSort Workshop applet, 
 *the index always goes from left to right, finding the largest item and carrying it toward out on the right. 
 *Modify the bubbleSort(â€‰) method so that it's bidirectional. 
 *This means the in index will first carry the largest item from left to right as before,
 *but when it reaches out, it will reverse and carry the smallest item from right to left. 
 *You'll need two outer indexes, one on the right (the old out) and another on the left.
