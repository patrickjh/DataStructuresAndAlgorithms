 *3.3 To the insertSort.java program (Listing 3.3), add a method called noDups( ) 
 *that removes duplicates from a previously sorted array without disrupting the order. 
 *(You can use the insertionSort( ) method to sort the data, or you can simply use main( ) to insert the data in sorted order.) 
 *One can imagine schemes in which all the items from the place where a duplicate was discovered to the end of the array 
 *would be shifted down one space every time a duplicate was discovered, 
 *but this would lead to slow O(N2) time, at least when there were a lot of duplicates. 
 *In your algorithm, make sure no item is moved more than once, no matter how many duplicates there are. 
 *This will give you an algorithm with O(N) time.
