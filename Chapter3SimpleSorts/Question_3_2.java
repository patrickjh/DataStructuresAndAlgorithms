 *3.2 Add a method called median(â€‰) to the ArrayIns class in the insertSort.java program (Listing 3.3). 
 *This method should return the median value in the array. 
 *(Recall that in a group of numbers half are larger than the median and half are smaller.) 
 *Do it the easy way.
 */
 
 
 /*
 Thoughts on how to solve this:
 	first sort the array
	find the middle items by going to
	index which is nelems divided in half
	check for modulus then do average of two 
	numbers if there is a modulus, 
	so if nelems%2 != 0, then take (a[nelems/2] + a[ (nelems/2 ) + 1]) / 2
	else take a[nelems/2]
	that is the median
	
test case: have a 10 item array. check if median is 
what i think it should be.
