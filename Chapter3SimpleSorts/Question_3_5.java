 *3.5 Modify the insertionSort(â€‰) method in insertSort.java (Listing 3.3) 
 *so it counts the number of copies and the number of comparisons it makes during a sort and displays the totals. 
 *To count comparisons, you'll need to break up the double condition in the inner while loop. 
 *Use this program to measure the number of copies and comparisons for different amounts of inversely sorted data. 
 *Do the results verify O(N2) efficiency? 
 *Do the same for almost-sorted data (only a few items out of place). 
 *What can you deduce about the efficiency of this algorithm for almost-sorted data?
