2.3 The removeMax( ) method in Programming Project 2.2 
suggests a way to sort the contents of an array by key value.
Implement a sorting scheme that does not require modifying the HighArray class,
but only the code in main( ). 
You'll need a second array, which will end up inversely sorted.
(This scheme is a rather crude variant of the selection sort in Chapter 3, “Simple Sorting.”)
